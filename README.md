# Simple-Information-Retrieval-System

Developed an Information Retrieval System(IRS)  with a vector model.    

The IRS  retrieves data from users's queries using two  specific collections: Cran and CISI.  

Evaluation metrics of the system and its performance were analyzed.  

Implemented query expansion through the K-Means grouping algorithm (for which we also rely on the use of the Elbow Method) and with user feedback support.  

"The problem of Information Retrieval can be summarized simply as 'given an information need (query + user profile + ... ) and a set of documents, order the documents from most to least relevant to that need and present a subset of the most relevant ones.'"
